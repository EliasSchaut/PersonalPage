# Bday 24  

## Improvements and New Highlights  

To keep this article concise, I’ll focus on what improved compared to the [previous Bday](bday23).  

### The New Website  

This year, I focused on creating an entirely new website with a more professional and polished feel. My goal was to mimic the look and feel of a hero page for a major corporation. I added intricate animations, stunning 3D effects, and vibrant particle effects. The design was rounded off with an elegant, Apple-inspired black-and-white aesthetic.  

However, the time spent perfecting the frontend took its toll on the backend. As a result, the planned shift management system wasn’t ready in time and had to be replaced with a Google Sheet. A small setback, but there’s always next year to implement it properly.  

### Speed-Friending with Icebreaker Questions  

Based on last year’s feedback, I integrated icebreaker questions into the Speed-Friending rounds. These not only helped kick-start conversations but also encouraged guests to mingle more effectively. This created a warm, relaxed atmosphere where even introverted guests found it easier to connect.  

### Sunset DJ: A Memorable Rooftop Moment  

Replacing karaoke with a DJ floor last year worked well but left karaoke fans slightly disappointed. This year, I came up with a creative solution to cater to both groups: the DJ set was moved to the rooftop and timed with the sunset. The combination of music, breathtaking views, and the setting sun created a magical atmosphere that thrilled many guests. Meanwhile, the karaoke stage remained open throughout the event, ensuring everyone got what they wanted.

### Art Corner: Creativity for Everyone  

Inspired by an activity from my first communion, I set up an art corner. Guests were presented with a canvas featuring pre-drawn puzzle pieces, which they could decorate with markers. The idea was for each person to design a puzzle piece, ultimately forming a collaborative artwork.  

At first, only the more artistically inclined guests approached the canvas, which made others hesitant. However, as the evening went on, many overcame their initial shyness, and the canvas gradually filled with an eclectic mix of patterns, drawings, and small messages. By the end of the night, only six puzzle pieces remained unpainted—a resounding success!

### New Metagame  

Of course, no birthday is complete without a new metagame. For more details, I’ll refer you to the [Metagame Article](bday24_meta).  

### Conclusion and Feedback  

The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The new additions, such as the Sunset DJ and the art corner, were particularly well-received. The icebreaker questions for Speed-Friending also garnered a lot of praise. The only suggestions for improvement were minor details, such as clearer communication about the schedule and adding more buffer time between activities, especially at the start of the event.
