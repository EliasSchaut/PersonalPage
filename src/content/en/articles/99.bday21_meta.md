# Bday Metagame 21

You have finally found the entrance to the lost temple of _Holy Ilias_.
Your long research has brought you here and you would do anything to uncover the secrets of this long-forgotten place.
After all, tradition has it that those who unravel the mysteries:grey_question:of that place will be granted access to long-lost documents!

So you enter the temple. You have purchased extra map paper and begin to map everything you see:

You stand up :arrow_down_small:. In front of you is a locked door :lock: on which, strangely enough, you can't see a keyhole. However, to your left is a room that immediately catches your eye.
The room is full of candles of all kinds. You are both shocked and fascinated by the fact that the candles are still burning. In the long time since anyone has been here, the candles:candle: should have burned out long ago!
What triggers an even greater fascination in you, however, is an elegantly decorated book lying in the middle of the room. You take a closer look at the book:

You open the book. On the first and only page is written:

_I am **Ho**ly **D**ungeon **Or**ders, but you may also call me Hodor!
I am a magical book and was created by my master himself!
I exist to grant those who pass my tests access to deeper and deeper realms of the sacred temple._

_Magical_? You are perplexed, but determined to face all the tests this book will put you through...

This is how the story of the _Holy Ilias_ and _Hodor_ begins on my birthday.
Since it was Corona at the time, the metagame also had to take place online, just like my birthday.
So I thought I would combine the Discord platform with a small metagame and send my participants on a puzzle hunt around various features of Discord.
I don't want to give too much away though, as this game can still be played by anyone who wants to.
It can be played in a slightly adapted form on the following Discord server: [𝓓𝓲𝓼𝓬𝓸𝓻𝓭-𝓓𝓾𝓷𝓰𝓮𝓸𝓷](https://discord.com/invite/4SdzCaenKs)

Around 20 people took part in this metagame and everyone really enjoyed it. The only criticism was that you needed a lot of Discord knowledge to solve the puzzles. But that was the whole point. Maybe I'll make the puzzles a bit easier at some point, or publish hints so that people who don't have a lot of Discord experience can solve the puzzles. Finally, my favorite feedback on the metagame:

> I'll find you Elias and then I'll ask you some questions to answer.

I hope that I was able to give you some inspiration for a metagame with this article.
