# Bday22: My First Big Offline Birthday After Corona

Corona is over, and we can finally meet offline again! While the joy of this is immense, it also brought me a brand-new challenge: organizing my birthday. For the past two years, I had celebrated my birthday online—simple, cheap, and hassle-free. No searching for a venue, no materials to organize, no stress. For a moment, I seriously considered doing it that way again. But when some friends told me how excited they were for an offline party, it was clear: Challenge accepted! After all, I’d organized plenty of birthdays and events for others—so surely, I couldn’t let my own birthday turn into a “flop,” right?

## The Perfect Venue – A Touch of K2 Magic

Having worked for years as the treasurer of the K2 Bar and as the deputy rooftop minister, the venue question was quickly settled: the rooftop and basement of House K2 in HaDiKo. This gave me access to a grill, a bar, and even a pool table—jackpot! Thanks to my experience with orientation events, I could also rely on tried-and-tested calculations for food and drinks. And since the K2 Bar always had a DJ to set the perfect techno vibe, that was a must as well.

But why settle for the standard? I wanted to spice things up: draft beer from a tap system, an improvised outdoor bar made of beer benches, and a small beer garden with beer table sets and beer pong. Slowly, it all started to come together. But something essential was still missing: the program.

## From Online Games to Offline Challenges

During my online birthdays, I divided guests into teams—Mannheim vs. Karlsruhe—and had them compete in various disciplines. It was a huge success, so I wanted to bring this concept into the offline world. Since this time more guests from Karlsruhe were expected, I decided on a neutral approach: Team Red versus Team Blue.

The teams wouldn’t be randomly assigned, though. Instead, I intentionally separated people who already knew each other to encourage mingling and new connections. To motivate the teams even more, I introduced a currency: each guest received three tokens at the start, which they could use to participate in challenges. Whether it was karaoke, beer pong, or a round of rock-paper-scissors—creativity had no limits!

I also set up several stations: a gaming corner with a Nintendo Switch, outdoor games like Kubb, and larger main events such as a mini-Olympics with crate runs and egg races. Thanks to my orientation event experience, I knew exactly how to set up the playing field (spray chalk to the rescue!).

Another highlight was an interactive quiz about me and birthdays in general, which I organized with Kahoot. And since I had created a metagame last year, I wanted to include an exciting game this time too—the details of which I’ll cover in a [separate article](bday22_meta) to keep this one concise.

The final program looked like this:

* 6:30 PM - Doors open  
* 7:00 PM - Official start  
* 7:00 PM - Opening of all stations (karaoke, grill, beer tap, pool table)  
* 8:00 PM - Official announcement (Elias) (K2 Bar main room)  
* 8:30 PM - Class Battle: Olympics (at the beer tap stand)  
* 10:30 PM - Class Battle: Kahoot (K2 Bar main room)  
* 11:45 PM - Gathering in the main room of K2 Bar  
* 12:00 AM - Countdown + Birthday celebration, cake, gifts, etc. + Speech  
* 1:00 AM - Class Battle results + Karaoke teardown + Dance floor setup  
* 1:30 AM - Opening of the disco  
* Afterward - Open end  

## The Ultimate Birthday Website  

So much planning—and I needed helpers! So, I did what any aspiring web developer would do: I built a website. It served both as an invitation and as a platform for shift assignments. I was most proud of the visitor counter, which showed live how many people had signed up, and a trailer I made with iMovie. After weeks of hard work, it was ready. But just before sending out 150 invitations, panic struck: What if the site didn’t work? But I hit "send"—and it was magical. Within an hour, 10 guests had signed up, and I received lots of praise for the website. A great feeling!  

## Showtime: The Big Day  

On the day of the party, everything was ready. Over 60 guests had signed up, and I had enough helpers. I wore a purple checkered shirt to make the red-blue blend joke—complete with a bow tie because the party felt like a children’s birthday for adults.  

As guests arrived, they were equipped with red or blue buttons and their tokens. I gave my opening speech, and the stations were officially opened. Most people headed straight for the grill before competing in the Olympics. At midnight, the highlight arrived: counting down to my birthday with 60 cheerful people. It was magical to bring together such a diverse group who, by the end, felt like one big community. That was my goal: to create a day where everyone could have fun—no drama, just joy.  

## And Then There Was the Garden Gnome…  

A little highlight at the end: Sometime during the night, a garden gnome suddenly appeared. Random guests had stolen it from a nearby garden and left it as a gift. The next day, a stressed neighbor showed up at my door asking if I knew anything about a missing garden gnome. Of course, I returned it—but for one evening, it was the party’s secret star.

## Conclusion and Lessons Learned  

For my first big offline birthday, everything went surprisingly smoothly. Of course, there are a few things I’d do better next time:  

* More chips! Two per person felt a bit stingy.  
* A game to help guests mingle better—like an introduction round.  
* Better photo organization to ensure no one gets left out.  
* Mark the venue better—the entrance was hard to find.  

But overall? A total success. And now, I’m already looking forward to the next challenge!
